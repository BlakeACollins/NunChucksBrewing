<main class="ourStoryContent">
    
    <h2>In the Beginning</h2>
    <p class="ourStoryParagraph">Back in 2006, in West Seattle, I noticed my neighbor out back drinking beer with his buddy, a football game on TV, and a bunch of steam coming out of a pot. Curiosity drew me over, and after a beer or two and some great conversation; I was gonna learn how to make beer!!  
    </p>
    
      <p class="ourStoryParagraph">They invited me to a few brew days, let me pitch in and sent me home with a 5 gallon bucket or two of my own to ferment and bottle a few great bottles of beer:) It wasn't more than a couple months later my wife bought me my first home brew kit, and I've never looked back.
      </p>
      <p class="ourStoryParagraph">
        I've been brewing now for 13 years, and I am still having a blast!! The world of beer is ever changing. I've learned a lot in the past years, and I'm still learning new things everyday! So thank you to the AMAZING beer community that is thriving today, both locally, as well as the huge online community. You have all helped me and so many others to become better brewers! 
        
        As for our name?? LOL... That's a long story!! But it's named after our Daughter, LOL and she loves it!!
      </p>
      <p class="ourStoryParagraph"> 
        After thirteen years of an AWESOME hobby here we are, making a move and having a blast doing it!! Thank you to all of  you who have given us support on this venture from the very start! We just want to continue to give you the best product we can and continue to grow with you for years to come!

So THANK YOU for being part of the Nun Chuck's family!!</p>

    <h2>The Futrure</h2>
    <p class="ourStoryParagraph">The future of craft beer is ever growing.  Our goal is to be a part of that future!
