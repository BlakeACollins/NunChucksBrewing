<main class="breweryNews">
    <p>Well, after a hard fought year we made it! Thanks to all of you who have supported us in 2019 to get
    this thing going. Without you I don’t know if we would have taken this leap to the next level.
    We started with a small GoFundMe campaign in January 2019, which put the wheels in motion. In
    early February our attorney began the filing process with the United States Patent and Trademark
    Office, which all-in-all would take about 7 months from start to finish.</p>
    <p>We created PAC NOW LLC with our Secretary of State and began to put our equipment and supplies together in early April. We
    ordered a couple custom made fermenters from over-seas that would eventually arrive 3 months
    later in late July.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Brian for helping me move and uncrate those heavy things! While the
    fermenters were being made we, my wife and I, began building our facility – AKA the Brew Haus!
    Huge shout out to my wife, we’d never be writing this right now without her! Building our facility
    took us quite a while, carpenters we are not… or at least we weren’t LOL!!</p>

    <p>Next we obtained our city license. A little shout out to the city of Lynnwood, they’ve been awesome and really supportive in
    helping us achieve our dream, so thank you for having us!! We purchased our brewing system upgrade from Sno-Town Brewing Co. in Snohomish, Wa. Great story, how we came to find that system, ask sometime I’ll tell ya’ all about it. We named it Herbie because it pretty much found us. After pulling electric and gas permits we began laying the electrical in early October. Thanks Alan and Deb! That was fun... until it wasn’t LOL!
  </p>

  <p> BIG shout out to Steve-E, thanks for cleaning it up
  brotha’! We passed that inspection and moved on to gas in early November. In the meantime, after
  70+ days, our Washington State Liquor License was approved, contingent on the federal level
  approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). The state sent out a Liquor
  Control Officer for a Laws and Regulations briefing and passed our floor plan in the Brew Haus. We
  are still awaiting approval from the TTB.... Meanwhile, the gas was laid and passed inspection.
  FINALLY, on the Monday before Thanksgiving 2019 the big news came in from TTB granting us our
  federal license!! BOOM!! Nun Chuck’s Brewing Company was officially born!
</p>

<p>
  With a few things left to button up before the New Year here we are, ready for a big 2020!! We’re
  hitting the New Year with huge goals and dreams, and we’re ready to have fun doing it!
  Again, a huge thank you to EVERYONE who has given us support, or had a hand in making this thing
  possible, from the bottom of the keg we love you guys! Shout out to Blake for building this amazing
  website, it would never have happened without ya’ man! To the man behind the logo and a hilarious branding story… Thank you Gary!!
</p>

<p>
  Keep following our story it’s gonna’ be a great ride! And for the latest news and updates keep
  checking back right here on our news feed. I’m sure we’ll posting great things!
  Here’s to a great New Year everyone!! CHEERS! Hold my beer we got this!!
